show dns-proxy statistics all: This command displays statistics related to the DNS Proxy feature. It provides information such as the number of DNS queries and responses processed, cache hits and misses, and other relevant metrics. It gives you an overview of the DNS Proxy activity on the firewall.

show dns-proxy cache all: This command shows the contents of the DNS Proxy cache. The DNS Proxy cache stores DNS records that have been resolved by the firewall.

This command allows you to view the cached DNS records, including the domain names, IP addresses, TTL (Time-to-Live) values, and other relevant details.
